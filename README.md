1. This a weather app where you enter the name of the city, country or place you want to know the weather of and then hit enter to get the weather.
2. You get the current weather of the place and to see the hourly forecast of that place you slider the slider.
3. You can also get the forecast of weather for the next 2 day form the day cards which are below the slider.
4. You can also click on the cards to get the hourly forecast of the next day and then slider the slider.
5. I wanted to make the background color to change when the slider is moved according to the time of the day. I will try to add that thing later
6. The way that I am adding a favicon I don't think is a good way to add the favicon.
