### Description
This is the assignment under **The Odin Porject**. In this assignment I was supposed to make a weather app that get the weather details of the location that user enters. Assignment also told us to add some kind of way to display the weather forecast. To do this I incorporated slider which provide the weather forecast for next 24 hrs. The idea of slider I got form the Microsoft edge weather thing. The edge weather thing also updates the background according to the time of day and weather type mine does not. Assignment mentioned to use any free weather api. This solution to the assignment is not the best and can be improved a lot.

### How To Use?

1. On the **first load** the app will load with the weather details of **Greenwich**.
2. If you want to know the weather of any other place then type the name of the place in the **Search Loaction** search box and press enter. The display will update with the weather details of the selected location.
3. The **default unit** of the **temperature** is **Celcius**. To get the temperature in **farenheit** click on the **F** under the C beside temperature.
4. **Slider** can be **moved** in left and right direction to get the **hoully details** of weather at specified **time**. When you move the slider the time and date will update accordingly as will the weather details according the weather forecast.
5. To get the **weather forecast** of **next day** click on the **cards** at the bottom. Slider can be used in same manner here also.
6. If the weather api cannot find the place you were looking for it might give an  **error** under the search box.
7. When you move the slider slow enough and reach at the time when is sun is setting or rising, then you can see the change in the background color according to the color of sky(not exactly). Color change is very fast.


### Things that can be imporved
- More days data can be provided in the weather forecast.
- Tranition of the background color during sunrise and sunset can be increased.
- The structure in which the data is displayed can be improved.
