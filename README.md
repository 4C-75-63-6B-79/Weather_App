# Jank Weather Thing

This is jank thing because the things can be improved a lot and person who really knows how to make things will spot the jank ness all over the place though I tried to keep jankness to very less compared to my other things that i made. So this is still jank like I could set all the values from the api in single array instead of making 3 array with total of about 97 objects which is bad. I could have reduced the object number to about 97 - 24 but did not. So this is one off many examples which proves that the thing is jank. So sorry.

1. This a weather app where you enter the name of the city, country or place you want to know the weather of and then hit enter to get the weather.
2. You get the current weather of the place and to see the hourly forecast of that place you slider the slider.
3. You can also get the forecast of weather for the next 2 day form the day cards which are below the slider.
4. You can also click on the cards to get the hourly forecast of the next day and then slider the slider.
5. I wanted to make the background color to change when the slider is moved according to the time of the day. I will try to add that thing later
6. The way that I am adding a favicon I don't think is a good way to add the favicon.
7. The background color is now changing according to the day light blue when day black blue when night and during sunrise and sunset transition happens.
8. To change the background color I am getting the differnce in current time to time to sunrise and sunset. And when any of the 2 values are in range go 30 min then the transition to that color happens form the hex values in the array stored.
9. Color of day and night may not be accurate as to the day weather and not accurate according to the color people to so it is what it is.
10. sunset and sunrise color transition is very small as 30 min on slider very fast so not that good but you can see if you slowly move the slider. It can be fixed if we expand those 30 min.
11. The color palette for the night sunrise noon sunset is here https://colordesigner.io/color-mixer/?mode=rgb#BEA9DE%7B0%7D-87889C%7B0%7D-546BAB%7B0%7D-2E4482%7B0%7D-131862%7B0%7D-FFA700%7B2%7D-FF8100%7B2%7D-FF6700%7B2%7D-FF4D00%7B1%7D-FF0000%7B2%7D-00ADFF%7B0%7D-27B9FF%7B0%7D-33BEFF%7B0%7D-4BC5FF%7B0%7D-6BCFFF%7B0%7D-6A0D83%7B0%7D-CE4993%7B0%7D-EE5D6C%7B0%7D-FB9062%7B0%7D-EEAF61%7B0%7D
